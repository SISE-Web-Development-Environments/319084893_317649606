# Assignment2

Hey user, welcome to "MSPacman"

https://sise-web-development-environments.github.io/assignment2-Sean-Maxim/


In order to start the game you either need to register (press "Sign Up" button) with your own register parameters or if you already has a user,
you can log in (press "Log in" button) with your username and password.
If you chose to register to the game, please make sure all register parameters filled correctly by the instructions on the assignment.
If you filled something wrong, the system will alert you.

If you want to play with a default username, you can just log in with a username "p" and a password "p".

In the "Options screen" you can set all your favorite parameters for the game or hit the "random" button and the game parameters will be set randomly.

In the "Game playing screen" there are few things you should know about them:

- First functionality we have added is the "Slow motion". You can see a snail icon that "jumps" every few seconds to other place on the board.
If the pacman eats the snail, all the monsters will move slow for a few seconds (and the game music will start to play with slow motion too :)).

- Second functionality we have added is the "God mode" power. You can see a green tube icon that "stands" on the same place on the board.
If the pacman eats the tube, the pacman turns to green and gets power for a few seconds. The power is than every time it tackles with a monsters, the pacman will not die and 
instead the specific monster that the pacman tackled with will be pushed to its initial place on the board.

- A moving star icon that if the pacman eats it, 50 points will be added to his score.

- A "Restart" button that will start a new game with the same game parameters you have chosen before.

- A "New game" button that will open again the "Options scree" that you can to choose new game parameters and that start a new game.

- If the music or the sound disturbes you, you can hit on the "Music button" and "Sound button" on the right of the screen to turn off and turn on the music and the sound. 


We hope you enjoyed our game.
